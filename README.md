Polska Table is a responsive restaurant website built with React and React Router. It includes a home page, menu pages, a contact page with a form, and an About Us page. The site is mobile-friendly, though it is best experienced on desktop. It features smooth transitions, hover effects, and a catch-all 404 page for undefined routes. This project was created to demonstrate my ability to work with React Router and build a multi-page, styled website.cd

You can view it live here Github Pages: https://jonaszdecember7-lab.github.io/Polska-Table/

This project uses React Router for multiple pages. Due to routing complexities with static hosting on Netlify, it is currently only hosted on GitHub Pages. All functionality works as expected.
